## 📘 Site Overview & Audience
**Study Almanac** is a small, calm website for students and instructors who prefer traditional, reliable study techniques presented clearly and without distraction.  
It organizes classic methods—like Pomodoro, active recall, and spaced repetition—into clean, interlinked sections. The site’s tone is quiet and academic, aimed at users who want clarity over flashiness.
